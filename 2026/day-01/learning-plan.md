# 90-Day Personal DevOps Learning Plan

## 1. Introduction & Current Level
I’m **Kiran Walase**, a working professional with **10+ years of experience** in software testing, including manual testing, automation testing with Java + Selenium, API testing, GitLab/Bitbucket usage, and hands-on database testing with MySQL & MongoDB.  

I have been a team lead for the past 2 years and currently work at **Jacobs as a Senior Automation Tester**. Now, I aim to transition into **DevOps and Cloud Engineering** to deepen my technical expertise and expand my career path.

## 2. Why I Am Starting DevOps & Cloud
I am starting DevOps & Cloud to:

- Strengthen my technical depth beyond testing  
- Stay relevant as organizations adopt CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud-native systems  
- Build automation pipelines and contribute to end‑to‑end delivery  
- Apply DevOps learnings in my project and conduct internal knowledge-sharing sessions  

---

## 3. My Understanding of DevOps
DevOps is a **culture and methodology** that brings Development and Operations together to deliver software **faster, reliably, and with automation across all stages**.

It emphasizes:

- Collaboration  
- CI/CD  
- Infrastructure as Code  
- Containerization  
- Cloud platforms  
- Continuous improvement  

For me, DevOps means **ownership, discipline, automation, and problem‑solving**.

- Docker & Containerization  
- Kubernetes fundamentals + deployments  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD  
- Terraform for IaC  
- Helm charts  
- Real projects + documentation real Projects on GitHub  
- Sharing progress on LinkedIn and GitHub to build visibility

2. **Create IaC using Terraform (optionally with Helm) to deploy a real application.**  
3. **Conduct internal trainings / mentor colleagues on DevOps tools and practices.**

---

## 6. Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build
- **Linux troubleshooting + shell commands**  
- **CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)**

- LinkedIn documentation for accountability  

---

## 8. How I Will Stay Consistent
- Fixed study schedule  
- Daily micro‑goals  
- Weekly review & adjustments  
- Public progress sharing  
- Focus on hands‑on practice, not over‑consuming tutorials
