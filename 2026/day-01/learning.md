1. Introduction & Current Level
I’m Kiran Walase, a working professional with 10+ years of experience in software testing, including manual testing, automation testing with Java + Selenium, API testing, GitLab/Bitbucket usage, and hands-on work with MySQL & MongoDB.
I have led teams for the past 2 years and currently work at Jacobs as a Senior Automation Tester.
Now I aim to transition into DevOps and Cloud Engineering to deepen my technical foundation and expand my career path.

2. Why I Am Starting DevOps & Cloud
I am starting DevOps & Cloud to:

Strengthen my technical depth beyond testing and enter a more infrastructure‑driven role.
Stay relevant as organizations rapidly adopt CI/CD, containerization, Kubernetes, and cloud-native technologies.
Build automation pipelines, optimize workflows, and contribute to end-to-end delivery systems—not just testing.
Eventually apply these skills in my current project and train others within my organization.


3. My Understanding of DevOps
DevOps is a culture and practice that integrates Development and Operations to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with automation at every stage.
It focuses on collaboration, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, containerization, cloud platforms, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
To me, DevOps is about ownership, discipline, automation, and problem-solving—not just tools.

4. What I Will Learn in the Next 90 Days
For the next 90 days, I will focus on hands-on learning with real tools and projects.
My areas of focus:

Linux (basic → advanced)
Python for automation
Docker & containerization
Kubernetes fundamentals + deployments
GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Terraform (IaC)
Helm charts
Building and documenting real projects
Sharing progress on LinkedIn and GitHub to build visibility

I will also create mini-projects and share my learning publicly to build consistency, credibility, and confidence.

5. My Top 3 Goals for These 90 Days

Build and deploy a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with Docker + Kubernetes.
Create IaC for a real application using Terraform and optionally Helm.
Teach or mentor at least 2–3 colleagues by sharing knowledge sessions or internal training.


6. Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build

Linux troubleshooting + command-line mastery
CI/CD pipelines with automation (GitHub Actions)
Kubernetes deployment, debugging, and container orchestration


7. Weekly Time Budget

Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours per day
Weekends: 5–6 hours
Daily assignments + mini-projects
Document everything through GitHub commits, notes, and LinkedIn posts


8. How I Will Stay Consistent

Fixed daily learning slot
Micro-goals instead of big goals
Weekly review to track progress
Sharing progress publicly for accountability
Practicing instead of over-consuming tutorials


9. My Commitment
This is my execution blueprint for the next 90 days.
I will follow this plan with discipline, consistency, and intent to transition into DevOps & Cloud Engineering and apply these skills in real projects.
